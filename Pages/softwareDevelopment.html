                    I am current employed as a software developer with Best Practice Software. I get to work on their
                    class
                    leading product, Premier. I employ a number of technical skills in the role that I have grown and
                    developed throughout my time at university. Including C#, databases, Visual Basic (xBase) and OOP
                    all
                    in an agile/scrum
                    methodology.

                <p>
                    Being given the freedom to tackle complex problems independently and then being able to rely on a
                    supportive team to back me up when I come across something a bit new and a bit too tricky is
                    amazing!
                    Because of this my knowledge of native applications has exploded.
                    I continue to look forward to new learning, growth and networking opportunities that come my way!

                        <h1>React Web App</h1>
                        <p>This was my first introduction into React or TypeScript. I was creating this project off of a
                            specification
                            from my university. It was a good opportunity to create something that I was able to show to
                            friends and family as it had an easy to understand and comprehend frontend. The premise was
                            to
                            be able to create musical samples using different instruments with the library tone.js. In
                            the
                            web app, users will create music samples to be shared to a
                            location (saved to an API).
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                User A opens the web app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A landing page is displayed with a button to create a new sample.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the user has previously created samples, a list of samples is also displayed on the
                                landing page, indicating whether it's been shared to a location (read via API).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When creating a new sample, they give it a name, and select an instrument type for the
                                sequence of notes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To build the sample, they toggle bars per note. This is played back to preview and saved
                                within the app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Back on the landing page, the sample is shared to one of the preset locations (create
                                via
                                API) for use in the mobile app.

                        <h1>React Native App</h1>
                        <p>Following straight on from my React Web App I moved into the native space. I worked in
                            android
                            and windows to create a mobile application. It made use of the device geolocation and
                            camera,
                            while integrating with public and private APIs.
                            Coming from React Web the move to Native was relatively easy.
                            In the mobile app, users can experience these music samples by physically visiting each
                            location
                            (read from the API).

                                User B opens the mobile app.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A map is displayed on the landing page, which they scroll around to find the nearest
                                preset
                                location (read via API).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They physically move to that location (e.g. a location on University campus), the
                                closeness
                                being detected via geolocation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When they are within range of the location, they unmute the music for that location,
                                which
                                is a playlist derived from the samples made in the web app (read via API).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They can customise their experience by adding their own “fingerprint” via device APIs.
                            </li>

                        <p>This was a project I worked on as part of an advanced web design course in university. It was
                            something I had a lot of fun creating, I am sure there is a better way of implementing the
                            functionality of the website and it is not accessible at all but it was a fun way to see
                            what I
                            could do from scratch in JavaScript. </p>

                            my
                            day to day work focuses on Visual Object and C#. It is a simple interface with
