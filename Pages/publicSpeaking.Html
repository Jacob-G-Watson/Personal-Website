                <h1>University</h1>
                <p>Working as a Student Ambassador for my university was one of the most fulfilling and valuable
                    experiences I had during my academic journey. The contracted role allowed me to develop and refine
                    my
                    presentation skills and facilitation skills to an exceptional level of quality and effectiveness. I
                    took great pleasure in engaging with various audiences, including prospective students, parents,
                    teachers, and university staff, and conveying my passion and knowledge for the university and its
                    programs. I also benefited from listening to their diverse perspectives and inquiries, which
                    challenged me to think critically and creatively about the university and its offerings.</p>
                <h1>After University</h1>
                <p>
                    Public speaking is one of my passions and strengths that I have cultivated since my time as a
                    Student Ambassador. I enjoy sharing my views and experiences on topics that interest me, as well as
                    learning from different viewpoints and perspectives of others. I have a curious and humble mindset
                    that drives me to explore various fields of knowledge and acknowledge the limits of my own
                    understanding. I always welcome opportunities to have meaningful and constructive discussions with
                    diverse audiences. In the past year, I have been involved in several public speaking engagements
                    related to my current company and industry. I have visited high school classrooms and delivered
                    presentations on the information technology sector and its career prospects. I have also
                    participated in panel discussions with other experts and professionals in the field, where we
                    exchanged insights and opinions on the latest trends and challenges in the industry.
